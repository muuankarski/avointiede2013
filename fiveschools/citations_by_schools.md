Cribb & Sari (2010) Monograph          Open Science - Sharing Knowledge in the digital age                                                   The accessibility of scientific knowledge is a matter of its presentation. *“Science is by nature complicated, making it all the more important that good science writing should be simple, clean and clear.” (p. 15)*
Grand et al (2012) Journal Article     Open Science: A New “Trust Technology”?                                                               Scientists can raise public trust by using web 2.0 tools *“As mainstream science and comment on science follows the pioneers into the realm of Web 2.0, to be able to navigate the currents of the information flow in this relatively unmapped territory, scientists and members of the public will all need reliable and robust tools.” (p. 685)*
Morris & Mietchen (2010) Proceedings   Collaborative Structuring of Knowledge by Experts and the Public                                      Using web 2.0 tools to make knowledge production accessible for the public. *(...) there is still plenty of opportunities for reinventing and experimenting with new ways to render and collaborate on knowledge production a nd to see if we can build a more stable, sustainable and collegial atmosphere (...) for experts and the public to work together.  (p. 32)*
Tacke (2012) Blog entry                Out of the Ivory Tower: Open Science.                                                                 The Web 2.0 gives scientists new opportunities to sprea d scientific knowledge to a wider public. *“Im einfachsten Fall können Wissenschaftler etwa in Blogs über Themen aus ihrem Fachgebiet berichten und Fragen von interessierten dazu beantworten.” (p. 2)*

(p. 8)*
Hand (2010) Article                    Citizen science: People power                                                                         Citizens possess valuable knowledge from which science can benefit. *“By harnessing human brains for problem solving, Foldit takes BOINC’s distributed computing concept to a whole new level.” (p. 2)*
Ebner & Maurer (2009) Article          Can microblogs and weblogs change traditional scientific writing?                                     Blogs can contribute to make research more accessible to the public. Yet they cannot replace articles and essays in scholarly communication. *“Weblogs and microblogs can enhan ce lectures by bringing the resources of the WorldWideWeb to the course and making them discussable. Both new technologies, however, cannot replace writing essays and articles, because of their different nature.” (p. 55)*
Catlin - Groves (2012) Review article  The Citizen Science Landscape: From Volunteers to Citizen Sensors and Beyond                          Citizens can help monitoring on a large scale. *“The areas in which it [citizen science] has, and most probably will continue to have, the greatest impact and potential are that of monitoring ecology or biodiversity at large geographic scales.” (p. 2)*
Powell & Colin (2009) Article          Participatory paradoxes: Facilitating citizen engagement in science and technology from the Top-Down? Citizen science projects are often short-lived *“Most participatory exercises do not engage citizens beyond an event or a few weeks/months, and they do not build citizens’ participatory skills in ways that would help them engage with scientists or policy makers independently.” (p. 327)*

Rufai et al. (2012) Journal Article            Open Access Journals in Library and Information Science: The Story so Far.                            Open access helps underdeveloped countries to bridge the gap between them and devel oped countries. *“The sustainability of open access journals in the field of LIS is evident from the study. Countries falling in the low-income economic zones have to come on open access canvas.” (p. 225)*
Phelps, Fox & Marincola (2012) Journal Article Supporting the advancement of science: Open access publishing and the role of mandates                Open access increases the dissemination of a scholar’s work *“Maybe one of the reasons that open access is an increasingly popular choice for society journals is that it fi ts well with many society missions to encourage the advancement of knowledge by providing the widest possible dissemination with no barriers to access.” (p. 3)*
Carrol (2011) Journal Article                  Why full open access matters                                                                          Open access helps overcoming the inefficiancy of traditional peer-review journals *“Pricing of traditional, subscription-financed scientific journals is highly inefficient. The growth in digital technologies and in digital networks should be driving down the price of access to the scholarly journal literature, but instead prices have increased at a rate greatly in excess of inflation” (p. 1)*
Harnad & Brody (2004)                          Comparing the Impact of Open Access (OA) vs. Non-OA Articles in the Same Journals                     Open access can increase the number of citations and helps skirting the high access tolls of journals. *“Access is not a sufficient condition for citation, but it is a necessary one. OA dramatically increases the number of potential users of any given article by adding those users who would otherwise have been unable to access it because their institution could not afford the access-tolls of the journal in which it appeared; therefore, it stands to reason that OA can only increase both usage and impact.”*
Harnad et al. (2004)                           The Access/Impact Problem and the Green and Gold Roads to Open Access                                 Only 5% of journals are gold, but over 90% are already green (i.e., they have given their authors the green light to self-archive); yet only about 10-20% of articles have been self-archived.*“Along with the substantial recent rise in OA consciousness worldwide, there has also been an unfortunate tendency to equate OA exclusively with OA journal publishing (i.e., the golden road to OA) and to overlook the faster, surer, and already more heavily traveled green road of OA self-archiving.” (p. 314)*
Antelmann (2004)                               Do Open-Access Articles Have a Greater Research Impact?                                               Open access articles have a higher research impact than not freely available articles. *“This study indicates that, across a variety of disciplines, open-access articles have a greater research impact than articles that are not freely available.”(p. 379)*

If publishers do not gladly accept this challenge, then scientists will rapidly find other ways of publishing data, probably through institutional, departmental, natio nal or international subject repositories. In any case the community will rapidly move to Open Data and publishers resisting this will be seen as a problem to be circumvented.” (p. 64)*
Vision (2010) Journal Article             Open Data and the Social Contract of Scientific Publishing                                            Data is a commodity. The sharing of data enables benefits other researchers. *“Data are a classic example of a public good, in that shared data do not diminish in value. To the contrary, shared data can serve as a benchmark that allows others to study and refine methods of analysis, and once collected, they can be creatively repurposed by many hands and in many ways, indefinitely.” (p. 330)*
Boulton et al. (2011) Comment             Science as a public enterprise: the case for open data                                                Data needs to be prepared in a usable format. *“Conventional peer-reviewed publications generally provide summaries of the available data, but not effective access to data in a usable format.” (p. 1634)*
Molloy (2011) Open Access Article         The open knowledge foundation: Open data means better science                                         Data should be free to reuse and redsitribute without restrictions. *“The definition of “open”, crystellised in the OKD, means the freedom to use, reuse, and redistribute without restrictions beyond a requirement for attribut ion and share-alike. Any further restrictions make an item closed knowledge.” (p. 1)*

By explicitly granting permissions, the grantor reassures those who may wish to use their data, and takes a conscious step to increase the pool of Open Data available to the web.” (p. 1)*
Andreoli-Versbach & Mueller-Langer (2013) Open Access to Data: An Ideal Professed but not Practised                                             Data sharing is not yet practiced in economics and often depends on the academic status. *The likelihood to share is positively associated with sharing other material, being full professor and being affiliated with a higher ranked institution.“ (p. 8)*

Nielsen (2012) Monograph                        Reinventing Discovery: The New Era of Networked Science *“We need to imagine a world where the construction of the scientific information commons has come to fruition. This is a world where all scientific knowledge has been made available online, and is expressed in a way that can be understood by computers” (ibid., p. 111)*

The widespread adoption of such open-source techniques will require significant cultural changes in science, as well as the development of new online tools. We believe that this will lead to the widespread use of mass collaboration in many fields of science, and that mass collaboration will extend the limits of human problem-solving ability.” (p. 881)*
