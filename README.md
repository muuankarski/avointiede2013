#### OA publishing models

1. Green Open Access – Archiving the final ”accepted manuscript” in a sustainable subject or institutional repository, usually with an embargo.
2. Gold Open Access – Direct Publication in an Open Access medium by applying creative commons license, article processing charges most likely needed.
3. Hybrid Open Access – Payment for Open Access for single articles in subscription journals
Some publishers and journals do not support open access. However, because of their reputation they might be intriguing for scholars.


#### OA monographs

Efforts to support Open Access monographs are emerging:
- [E-Thesis](http://ethesis.helsinki.fi/en) – Finnish universities’ service to     publish open access dissertations and theses 
- [OpenEdition Books](http://books.openedition.org/?lang=en) – a service for publishers to create OA monographs.
